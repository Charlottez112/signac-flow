develop:

	- Add the FlowGraph, which allows the user to implement workflows in
		form of a graph.
	- Add the label decorators, allowing a more concise definition of
		methods which are to be used for classification.
	- The submission logic has been refactored:
		- The write_user() function has been replaced by submit_user() with
			slightly adjusted API.
		- The header and environment module have been merged into a single
			environment module.
		- All submit logic has been removed from the scheduler drivers.
		- Any submit logic implemented as part of the environment module has
			been reduced to the bare minimum.
		- The submission flow has been refactored to be based on JobOperations.
		- An attempt is made to detect the use of the deprecated API which will
			trigger the use of a legacy code path and the emission of warnings.
		- Improved testing capabilities for unknown environments.
		- The determination of present environments is determistic and based
			on reversed definition order.
