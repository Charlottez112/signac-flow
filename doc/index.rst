The signac-flow tool provides the basic components to setup simple to complex workflows for `signac projects <https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/signac>`_.
That includes the definition of data pipelines, execution of data space operations and the submission of operations to high-performance super computers.

The implementation is in pure Python, requires signac_ and is tested for Python versions 2.7 and 3.4+.
